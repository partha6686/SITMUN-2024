        text:"Having known that SIT MUN was being organised by some of the brightest minds, I went in with a lot of expectations and all of them got fulfilled after witnessing the level of debate, the sheer attention to detail in organisation and the dedication of the team at making everyone feel comfortable. The organising committee members always stood ready to help you even before you could ask for it and in terms of debate, the research and the discourses were exceptional in every way. Owing to its strong legacy, I’m looking forward to the new benchmarks that SIT MUN 2024 is going to set!        ",

Surprisingly, it turned out to be a delightful experience, shattering my preconceived notions. Reflecting on it now, I cherish the memories it created and the valuable lesson it taught me about embracing change. SITMUN not only broadened my perspective on MUNs and literary events but also uncovered a side of me that craves exploration. I encourage others to take the plunge, as I regret not starting earlier. Best wishes to everyone embarking on their MUN journey – may it be as enriching as mine! Happy Mun-ning!        ",
