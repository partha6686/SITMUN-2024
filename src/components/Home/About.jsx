            simulation that imitates the procedures of the United Nations
            finding solutions for real-world problems, done through an academic
            simulation of the United Nations procedure. The MUN 
            consists of negotiation, discussion, and lively debates, which is
            the cornerstone of UN activity. Model United Nations aims to educate students
            about current events, international relations, diplomacy, and the
            United Nations agenda. Along with knowledge of the world we live in,
            participants develop skills including public speaking, presentation,
            persuasion, situation analysis, research, and critical thinking.
            SITMUN is an inter-collegiate conference conducted every year.
            Students from Silicon University and other institutions across and outside Odisha 
            enthusiastically participate as a represented delegate 
            in various committees.
