//               welcome you all to the 6th iteration of the SIT Model United
//               Nations conference! I have been a part of SITMUN as a Delegate,
//               Coordinator, and OC Member, and it is now my privilege to lead the
//               Secretariat as Secretary General for the conference. With my
//               incredible team, I am confident that this year’s conference will
//               surpass all expectations for SITMUN and redefine what our
//               conference has historically delivered. SITMUN's mission is simple;
//               we strive to provide young leaders a stimulating platform to
//               debate, discuss, and resolve critical global issues by promoting
//               equity, creativity, and diplomacy. At SITMUN, Model United Nations
//               is more than a simulation of the UN, but rather, it is a space for
//               delegates to delve into the world of international issues and
//               develop stronger public speaking, communication, critical
//               thinking, and diplomacy skills. Whether you are the most
//               passionate and knowledgeable political thinker or, perhaps, are
//               someone foreign to the world of diplomacy, SITMUN is for you. To
//               my delegates— SITMUN is your space to collaborate, engage and
//               debate the world of today, to lead the world of tomorrow. The
//               legacy of SITMUN is established by a long line of predecessors who
//               have established our conference as one of the best in the circuit.
//               This year is no exception, as the 6th iteration of SITMUN could
//               not be possible without the contributions of my hard-working,
//               passionate, and dedicated Secretariat and OC members. They are,
//               genuinely, one of the most brilliant individuals I know, and I
//               have no doubt that their talents and efforts will reflect in your
//               SITMUN experience. I am thrilled to see what SITMUN 2024 will
//               bring, and I am incredibly excited to welcome you all to the
//               conference this March."
