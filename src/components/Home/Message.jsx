              "My name is Namrata Mishra, and it is with distinct honour that I
              welcome you all to the 6th iteration of the SIT Model United
              Nations conference! I have been a part of SITMUN as a Delegate,
              Coordinator, and OC Member, and it is now my privilege to lead the
              Secretariat as Secretary General for the conference. With my
              incredible team, I am confident that this year’s conference will
              surpass all expectations for SITMUN and redefine what our
              conference has historically delivered. SITMUN's mission is simple;
              we strive to provide young leaders a stimulating platform to
              debate, discuss, and resolve critical global issues by promoting
              equity, creativity, and diplomacy. At SITMUN, Model United Nations
              is more than a simulation of the UN, but rather, it is a space for
              delegates to delve into the world of international issues and
              develop stronger public speaking, communication, critical
              thinking, and diplomacy skills. Whether you are the most
              passionate and knowledgeable political thinker or, perhaps, are
              someone foreign to the world of diplomacy, SITMUN is for you. To
              my delegates— SITMUN is your space to collaborate, engage and
              debate the world of today, to lead the world of tomorrow. The
              legacy of SITMUN is established by a long line of predecessors who
              have established our conference as one of the best in the circuit.
              This year is no exception, as the 6th iteration of SITMUN could
              not be possible without the contributions of my hard-working,
              passionate, and dedicated Secretariat and OC members. They are,
              genuinely, one of the most brilliant individuals I know, and I
              have no doubt that their talents and efforts will reflect in your
              SITMUN experience. I am thrilled to see what SITMUN 2024 will
              bring, and I am incredibly excited to welcome you all to the
              conference this March."
